# ApexChain - A Java-Based Blockchain Implementation

ApexChain is a simple blockchain implementation in Java that simulates wallet creation, transactions, and block mining. It demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain technology, including cryptographic signatures, proof-of-work, and transaction validation.

---

## **Features**
- **Wallet Creation**: Generate public and private keys using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
- **Transactions**: Send funds between wallets with secure cryptographic signatures.
- **Block Mining**: Mine blocks using a proof-of-work algorithm (hash with leading zeros).
- **UTXO Model**: Track unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to validate transactions.
- **Blockchain Validation**: Verify the integrity of the blockchain by checking block hashes and transaction signatures.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Genesis Block**: The first block in the blockchain is created with an initial transaction.
2. **Wallets**: Users can create wallets, which generate public and private key pairs.
3. **Transactions**: Wallets can send funds to each other by creating and signing transactions.
4. **Mining**: Transactions are added to blocks, which are mined by solving a proof-of-work problem.
5. **Validation**: The blockchain is validated by checking the integrity of each block and its transactions.

## **Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ApexChain.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ApexChain
   ```

3. Compile and run the project:
   ```bash
   javac ApexChain.java
   java ApexChain
   ```

## **Project Structure**
- **ApexChain.java**: Main class to run the blockchain simulation.
- **Wallet.java**: Handles wallet creation and transaction signing.
- **Block.java**: Represents a block in the blockchain.
- **Transaction.java**: Handles transactions between wallets.
- **StringUtil.java**: Utility class for cryptographic operations (SHA-256, ECDSA).

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **BouncyCastle**: Cryptographic library for ECC and SHA-256.
- **SHA-256**: Hashing algorithm for block hashes.
- **ECDSA**: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm for transaction signing.

## **Future Improvements**
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Implement a peer-to-peer network for decentralized blockchain.
- Add support for smart contracts.
- Improve transaction validation and error handling.
